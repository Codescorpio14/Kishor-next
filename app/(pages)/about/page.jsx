            I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer
            Science and Engineering from the American International
            University-Bangladesh. I have a strong background in programming and
            web development, specializing in Angular and ASP.NET Core, and I'm
            proficient in Java, Python, and C++. During my internships, I gained
            valuable experience in project research, planning, and working
            directly with clients. I've also been recognized for my achievements
            in cybersecurity challenges, particularly in hacking competitions.
            I'm excited to bring my skills to a dynamic and innovative
            environment where I can contribute to meaningful projects and
            continue to grow professionally.

              With a solid track record in designing websites, I deliver strong
              and user-friendly digital designs. (Since 2024 only in combination
              with development)

            <p>
              I build scalable websites from scratch that fit seamlessly with
              design. My focus is on micro animations, transitions and
              interaction. Build with Kirby CMS or Webflow.

              The full package
            </h4>
            <p>
              A complete website from concept to implementation, that's what
              makes me stand out. My great sense for design and my development
              skills enable me to create kick-ass projects.
